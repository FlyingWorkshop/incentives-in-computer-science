# CS269I: Incentives in Computer Science

Online course reader for Stanford's CS269I based on notes from the amazing [Eric Gao](https://twitter.com/gaoooric) and lectures from [Aviad Rubinstein](https://cs.stanford.edu/~aviad/). This course covers many topics across algorithmic game theory (AGT).


## Additional Resources

For additional resources, check out the [AGT textbook](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F13/algorithmic-game-theory.pdf) and also these related courses:

* [Tim Roughgarden (Columbia)](https://timroughgarden.org/): Started CS269I when he taught at Stanford.
* [Eva Tardos (Cornell)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6840/2017sp/schedule.htm): Wonderfully scribed notes on AGT.
* [Paul Milgrom (Stanford)](https://flyingworkshop.github.io/market-design/intro.html): Shameless plug for a course reader on undergraduate market design I wrote while TA'ing for Paul.



## Contributing

The course reader is built around [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html). To contribute, it will be helpful to familiarize yourself with (in order of importance):$\LaTeX$, Markdown, Python, Sphinx, and some basic HTML.
